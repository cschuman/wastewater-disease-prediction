## What Gold Means

At **Gold (76/100)**, you can credibly say:

- "This project follows OpenSSF security best practices"
- "We have professional governance and a public roadmap"
- "There's a clear path from contributor to maintainer"
- "We're working toward foundation-level maturity"

## Path to Platinum (90+)

After Gold, the focus shifts to **community building**:

| Bus factor | 1 | 3+ |
| Organizations | 1 | 3+ |

Platinum requires **people**, not just documents.
