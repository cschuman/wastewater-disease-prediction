URBAN/RURAL CONFOUNDING ANALYSIS - QUICK REFERENCE
================================================================================

RESEARCH QUESTION:
  Is the SVI-monitoring gap confounded by urbanization?
  (Rural areas have less sewer infrastructure → could explain the gap)

ANSWER:
  PARTIAL CONFOUNDING - Gap is real but urbanization-dependent
  
  ✓ SVI effect PERSISTS after controlling for urban/rural (p=0.007)
  ✓ Effect reduced by only 11% (not eliminated)
  ✓ Gap exists ONLY in urban counties (β=-0.74, p=0.0002)
  ✓ No gap in rural counties (all have low coverage)

================================================================================

KEY STATISTICS:

  1. SVI-Urbanization Correlation
     r = 0.012 (p=0.51)  →  Nearly INDEPENDENT

  2. Baseline Model (no control)
     Sites per 100k ~ SVI
     β = -0.811, p=0.022, R²=0.008

  3. Controlled Model (+ RUCC)
     Sites per 100k ~ SVI + RUCC
     β = -0.721, p=0.007, R²=0.441
     Change: -11%  →  PERSISTS

  4. Stratified by Urbanization
     
     Urban counties (n=422):
       β = -0.739, p=0.0002 ***  →  STRONG EFFECT
     
     Rural counties (n=256):
       β = -0.478, p=0.524       →  NO EFFECT

================================================================================

INTERPRETATION:

  The equity gap is NOT simply rural areas lacking infrastructure.
  
  Even among URBAN counties with wastewater treatment plants,
  socially vulnerable communities have fewer monitoring sites.
  
  This indicates DIFFERENTIAL RESOURCE ALLOCATION within urban
  infrastructure systems, not just rural infrastructure limitations.

================================================================================

POLICY IMPLICATION:

  Target URBAN high-SVI counties for wastewater monitoring expansion.
  
  The gap is not about building sewers in rural areas—it's about
  equitable allocation of monitoring resources in existing urban systems.

================================================================================

STATISTICAL CONCLUSION:

  Classification: PARTIAL CONFOUNDING
  
  Criteria:
    ✓ Coefficient changed >10%     (11% reduction)
    ✓ Effect remains significant   (p=0.007)
    ✓ Confounder explains variance (ΔR²=0.433)
  
  Urbanization is a confounder that explains PART of the variance,
  but the SVI-monitoring gap is REAL and independent of urbanization.
