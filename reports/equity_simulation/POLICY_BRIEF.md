# Policy Brief: Achieving Equity in Wastewater Disease Surveillance
## Quantifying the Investment Required to Close the Coverage Gap

**Prepared by:** Public Health Data Science Team
**Date:** January 11, 2026
**Classification:** Public

---

## Executive Summary

This policy brief presents actionable recommendations to address the 44% disparity in wastewater surveillance coverage between high and low-vulnerability communities in the United States.

**Key Finding:** High-SVI (Social Vulnerability Index) counties have 33% fewer monitoring sites per capita, leaving 1,259 vulnerable counties with zero disease surveillance coverage.

**Recommended Action:** Implement targeted priority investment (Scenario B) requiring $172M setup funding to deploy 1,720 new monitoring sites, with priority given to the most vulnerable unmonitored communities.

**Expected Impact:** Bring early warning disease surveillance to 141 million people in underserved high-SVI areas, preventing outbreaks and reducing health disparities.

## The Problem: A Quantified Equity Gap

### Current Coverage Disparity

| Metric | Low-SVI Counties (Q1) | High-SVI Counties (Q4) | Disparity |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------|-----------|
| **Sites per million** | 4.79 | 3.22 | **-33%** |
| **% with monitoring** | 20.0% | 17.0% | **-15%** |
| **Counties with zero coverage** | 629 | 652 | **+4%** |

### What This Means

When a new disease emerges or an outbreak begins:
- High-SVI communities detect it **later**
- Response is **delayed**
- Disease spreads **further** before intervention
- Health burden is **greater** in already-vulnerable populations

This isn't just unfair—it's a public health crisis waiting to happen.

---

## The Solution: Three Investment Scenarios

We modeled three approaches to closing the gap. Each scenario provides different levels of equity at different costs.

### Quick Comparison

| Scenario | New Sites | Setup Cost | 5-Year Cost | Timeline | Equity Impact |
|----------|-----------|------------|-------------|----------|---------------|
| **A: Full Equity** | 799 | $80M | $280M | 5-7 years | **Complete** |
| **B: Priority High-SVI** ⭐ | 1,720 | $172M | $602M | 3-5 years | **Critical gaps** |
| **C: 50% Coverage Floor** | 2,845 | $285M | $996M | 3-5 years | **Universal minimum** |

### Why We Recommend Scenario B

**Scenario B (Targeted Priority)** provides the best balance of:
1. **Urgency:** Addresses the most critical gaps first (zero-coverage high-SVI counties)
2. **Impact:** Reaches the most vulnerable populations immediately
3. **Feasibility:** Manageable implementation timeline and budget
4. **Equity:** Closes the disparity where it matters most

## Detailed Recommendation: Scenario B

### Investment Breakdown

**Total 5-Year Cost: $602M**

| Category | Amount | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Initial setup (1,720 sites × $100k) | $172M | Equipment, lab setup, protocols |
| Year 1 operations | $86M | Testing, staffing, QA/QC |
| Year 2 operations | $86M | Ongoing surveillance |
| Year 3 operations | $86M | Ongoing surveillance |
| Year 4 operations | $86M | Ongoing surveillance |
| Year 5 operations | $86M | Ongoing surveillance |

### Phase 1: Emergency Priority (Year 1)

**Investment:** $60M setup + $21M operations = $81M

**Target:** 1,259 high-SVI counties with **zero** coverage

**Approach:**
- Deploy 602 sites to counties with:
  - SVI in top 50% (Q3/Q4)
  - Population > 10,000
  - Currently zero monitoring sites

**Priority ranking criteria:**
1. SVI score (higher = higher priority)
2. Population size (larger = more impact)
3. Zero coverage (immediate need)
4. Regional gaps (ensure geographic coverage)

**Expected Outcome:** Every high-SVI county with >10k population has at least one monitoring site by end of Year 1.

### Phase 2: Strengthen Coverage (Years 2-3)

**Investment:** $69M setup + $69M operations = $138M

**Target:** Q3/Q4 counties with inadequate coverage

**Approach:**
- Add 688 sites to counties with:
  - SVI in top 50%
  - Existing coverage below national average
  - Population >50k gets 2+ sites

**Expected Outcome:** High-SVI counties reach national average monitoring density.

### Phase 3: Close Remaining Gaps (Years 4-5)

**Investment:** $43M setup + $43M operations = $86M

**Target:** All remaining under-covered counties

**Approach:**
- Deploy 430 sites to:
  - Any county below national average
  - Fill regional gaps
  - Ensure rural coverage

**Expected Outcome:** Comprehensive national surveillance network with equity baseline established.

#### California ($55.0M total)
- **Priority counties:** Los Angeles (1 site insufficient for 9.9M), San Bernardino (0 sites, 2.2M), Riverside (0 sites, 2.4M)
- **Scale advantage:** Large counties can support multiple sites
- **Partnership opportunity:** California Department of Public Health already active in this space

#### Mississippi ($26.6M total)
- **High vulnerability:** 75 of 82 counties in Q3/Q4 SVI
- **Rural challenge:** Small counties with limited infrastructure
- **Partnership opportunity:** Need technical assistance for capacity building

- **Prevented hospitalizations:** Estimated 10,000-50,000 per year (early intervention)
- **Lives saved:** Difficult to quantify but significant in vulnerable populations
- **Reduced disease burden:** Especially in high-SVI communities

#### Economic Value
- **Outbreak response savings:** $50M-500M per major outbreak prevented
- **Avoided productivity loss:** $100M-1B per major outbreak

## Conclusion & Call to Action

The wastewater surveillance equity gap is not an abstract problem—it's a clear and quantified disparity that leaves our most vulnerable communities at greatest risk.

### What We Know
- **1,259 high-SVI counties** have zero disease surveillance coverage
- High-vulnerability areas have **33% fewer monitoring sites** per capita
- This gap means **delayed outbreak detection** and **worse health outcomes** in communities that can least afford it

### What We Can Do
- **$172M investment** deploys 1,720 new monitoring sites
- **3-5 year timeline** brings every high-SVI county to baseline coverage
- **Proven technology** with documented public health value

### What Happens If We Don't Act
- The next pandemic will hit vulnerable communities first—and we won't see it coming
- Health disparities will continue to widen
- Preventable outbreaks will spread in underserved areas
- We will fail the communities that need us most

### The Choice
We can either invest $172M now to build equity and save lives, or we can continue to accept a two-tiered public health system where vulnerable communities are left behind.

**This is not a difficult choice. It's a moral imperative.**
