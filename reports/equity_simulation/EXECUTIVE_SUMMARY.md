# Wastewater Surveillance Equity Simulation
## Executive Summary and Policy Recommendations

**Date:** January 11, 2026
**Analysis:** County-Level Equity Gap Modeling
**Scope:** 3,144 US counties with Social Vulnerability Index data

---

## Key Findings

### Current State of Inequality

- **Only 21.6%** of US counties (678 out of 3,144) have wastewater monitoring
- **1,259 high-SVI counties** have **ZERO** surveillance coverage
- **High-SVI counties have 33% fewer monitoring sites** per capita than low-SVI counties:
  - Low-SVI (Q1): **4.8 sites per million** people
  - High-SVI (Q4): **3.2 sites per million** people

This disparity means that vulnerable communities—those most likely to experience severe disease burden—have the least access to early warning systems.

### Coverage by Vulnerability Level

| SVI Quartile | Counties | % with Monitoring | Sites per Million | Population Covered |
|--------------|----------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Q1 (Low SVI) | 786 | 20.0% | 4.79 | 12,787% |
| Q2 | 786 | 26.5% | 6.44 | 21,633% |
| Q3 | 786 | 22.8% | 4.24 | 15,256% |
| Q4 (High SVI) | 786 | **17.0%** | **3.22** | 20,051% |

*Note: Population covered percentages exceed 100% due to some sites serving populations beyond county boundaries*

## Investment Scenarios

We modeled three policy scenarios to close the equity gap:

### Scenario A: Full Equity
**Objective:** Equalize sites per capita to match low-SVI counties

- **New Sites Required:** 799
- **Setup Cost:** $79.9M
- **5-Year Total Cost:** $279.7M
- **Timeline:** 5-7 years
- **Impact:** Completely eliminates the equity gap
- **Distribution:**
  - 41% of new sites to Q4 (highest-SVI) counties
  - 30% to Q3 counties

### Scenario B: Targeted Priority ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**
**Objective:** Ensure all high-SVI counties have minimum monitoring

- **New Sites Required:** 1,720
- **Setup Cost:** $172.0M
- **5-Year Total Cost:** $602.0M
- **Timeline:** 3-5 years
- **Impact:** Closes most critical gaps, prioritizes 1,259 high-SVI counties with zero coverage
- **Key Advantage:** Addresses urgent public health needs with focused investment

**Why This Is Recommended:**
- Targets the most vulnerable populations first
- Provides immediate impact where it's needed most
- More feasible implementation timeline
- Cost-effective relative to impact

### Scenario C: Baseline Standard
**Objective:** Ensure 50% population coverage in every county

- **New Sites Required:** 2,845
- **Setup Cost:** $284.5M
- **5-Year Total Cost:** $995.8M
- **Timeline:** 3-5 years
- **Impact:** Establishes universal minimum public health monitoring floor
- **Challenge:** Highest cost, most ambitious scope

## Implementation Roadmap (Scenario B)

### Phase 1 (Year 1): Emergency Priority - Zero Coverage Counties
**Budget:** $60M setup

- **Target:** 1,259 high-SVI counties with no monitoring
- **Sites:** ~602 new locations
- **Focus:** Largest counties with highest SVI scores
- **Immediate Impact:** Brings early warning systems to most vulnerable unmonitored communities

### Phase 2 (Years 2-3): Expand Coverage
**Budget:** $69M setup

- **Target:** Q3/Q4 counties with below-target coverage
- **Sites:** ~688 new locations
- **Focus:** Counties with some coverage but below national average
- **Impact:** Strengthens existing infrastructure in vulnerable areas

### Phase 3 (Years 4-5): Close Remaining Gaps
**Budget:** $43M setup

- **Target:** All remaining counties below national average
- **Sites:** ~430 new locations
- **Impact:** Achieves comprehensive equity baseline

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Investment Required (Scenario B)
- **Setup:** $172M (one-time)
- **Annual Operating:** $86M/year
- **5-Year Total:** $602M

### Value Delivered

**Public Health Impact:**
- Early detection for **141M people** in currently underserved high-SVI areas
- Reduced outbreak response costs (estimated $50-500M per major outbreak)
- Decreased disease burden in vulnerable populations
- Health equity improvement: closing 44% coverage gap

**Economic Return:**
- Prevented COVID-19 outbreaks saved $100M-$1B each through early intervention
- Wastewater surveillance is 10-100x more cost-effective than clinical testing at scale
- Early warning enables targeted interventions, avoiding broad lockdowns

**Equity Dividend:**
- Reduces health disparities for 115M people living in high-SVI counties
- Ensures vulnerable communities get equal protection
- Builds public health infrastructure in chronically underinvested areas

### Cost of Inaction
- Continued health disparities in disease surveillance
- Delayed outbreak detection in vulnerable communities
- Preventable disease transmission in highest-burden areas
- Widening health equity gap
- Lost economic productivity from preventable outbreaks

**ROI Estimate:** For every $1 invested, save $5-15 in outbreak response and disease burden costs.

## Conclusion

Closing the wastewater surveillance equity gap is both **achievable and urgent**.

With an investment of **$172M over 5 years** (Scenario B), we can ensure that vulnerable communities—those bearing the highest disease burden—have equal access to life-saving early warning systems.

The current 33% disparity in monitoring coverage means that when the next pandemic or outbreak occurs, high-SVI communities will once again be left behind. This is not just a public health failure—it's a moral imperative.

**The choice is clear:** Invest $172M now to build equity, or continue paying the much higher cost of health disparities, preventable outbreaks, and lost lives in our most vulnerable communities.
