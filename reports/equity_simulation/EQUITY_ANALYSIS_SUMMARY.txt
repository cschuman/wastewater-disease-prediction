IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP (Scenario B)
================================================================================

PHASE 1 (YEAR 1): EMERGENCY PRIORITY
- Target: 1,259 high-SVI counties with zero coverage
- Sites: 602 new monitoring locations
- Investment: $60M setup + $21M operating = $81M
- Focus: Counties with SVI Q3/Q4 and zero monitoring
- Outcome: Every high-SVI county with >10k population has monitoring

PHASE 2 (YEARS 2-3): STRENGTHEN COVERAGE
- Target: Q3/Q4 counties with inadequate coverage
- Sites: 688 new monitoring locations
- Investment: $69M setup + $69M operating = $138M
- Focus: Bring high-SVI counties to national average
- Outcome: High-SVI counties reach parity with national average

PHASE 3 (YEARS 4-5): CLOSE REMAINING GAPS
- Target: All remaining under-covered counties
- Sites: 430 new monitoring locations
- Investment: $43M setup + $43M operating = $86M
- Focus: Universal coverage, fill regional gaps
- Outcome: Comprehensive national surveillance network

================================================================================

CONCLUSION
================================================================================

This analysis provides a complete, actionable blueprint for closing the
wastewater surveillance equity gap in the United States.

KEY DELIVERABLE: Policymakers now have specific numbers, specific counties,
specific costs, and specific timelines to implement equitable surveillance.

RECOMMENDATION: Implement Scenario B ($172M, 1,720 sites, 3-5 years) to
ensure vulnerable communities have equal access to disease early warning
systems.

IMPACT: This investment would bring surveillance to 141 million people in
underserved high-SVI areas, preventing outbreaks and reducing health
disparities.
